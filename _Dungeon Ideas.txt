Central theme - there is an ominous door you have to walk through. This triggers a randomized event-based quest, where you have to correctly traverse an obstacle in a dungeon to eventually get an evidence card.

If a player fails the quest, they get thrown out of the dungeon. Whether successful or failure, the player must wait a certain amount of time to enter the dungeon again.

Upon succeeding the event, the player has the option to... 
    1) Go get their evidence card and leave the dungeon

    2) Go further down the dungeon and attempt to get a sabatogue card. This will trigger a harder event that the player must succeed in. 
        If they succeed they get both the evidence card and a sabatogue card, which they can play on other players for some benefit.
        If they fail, they themselves will be sabatogued (some ill effect will happen to them) and be thrown out of the dungeon. 

Players can also randomly find items in the dungeon, which they can use for various purposes. Examples include
    - A de-obfustigation mirror, which reveals the first letter of an answer in a riddle.
    - A sword, which can be used to fight monsters.
    - A sleuthy card, which allows one to bypass certain types of monsters.
 
Players also have unique traits which they can use in their journeys.
